   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/profchengMiT/second-attempt.git
   cd second-attempt
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Using venv
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/  # if tests are available
   ```

5. **Explore the Project**:
   - Check out the `docs/` folder for documentation
   - Review the `examples/` folder for sample code
   - Run the quickstart notebook if available

### Running the Project

```bash
# Example command - adjust based on your project structure
python main.py

# Or for Jupyter notebooks
jupyter notebook
```

### Configuration

If configuration files are needed:
1. Copy the template configuration: `cp config.example.py config.py`
2. Edit `config.py` with your settings
3. Run with: `python main.py`

### Troubleshooting

- **ImportError**: Ensure your virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed
- **Module not found**: Try reinstalling requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall`
- **Permission denied**: On macOS/Linux, try: `chmod +x your_script.py`
